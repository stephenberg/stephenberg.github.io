<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> About Me</h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor of statistics at Penn State University. I joined Penn State in 2020 after receiving my PhD in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was advised by Jun Zhu and Murray Clayton.</p>
<p>My research focuses on applications in spatial and spatial-temporal statistics, as well as on statistical computing problems, particularly related to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistical computing</li>
</ul>
<p>My current work revolves around variance estimation and variance reduction for MCMC simulations. MCMC simulations are now standard computational tools in Bayesian statistics, for estimating things like posterior means and credible intervals.</p>
<pre><code>* Recently I have worked in collaboration with Hyebin Song at PSU on nonparametric variance estimation for MCMC variances, using tools similar to classical shape-constrained regression approaches like isotonic regression.</code></pre>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial-temporal statistics
<ul>
<li>I have worked on application problems in landscape ecology and in modeling chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Wisconsin deer. Generally, I am interested in constructing realistic models of natural phenomena in order to do inference and forecasting. Methodologically I am interested in differential equation and partial differential equation models, and addressing statistical and computational challenges for these models.</li>
<li>A recently added focus on the theory side is the nonparametric estimation of spatial covariance functions.</li>

<!-- **XMin** is a Hugo theme written by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org) in about four hours: half an hour was spent on the Hugo templates, and 3.5 hours were spent on styling. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a really minimal example to beginners of Hugo templates. This XMin theme contains about 130 lines of code in total, including the code in HTML templates and CSS (also counting empty lines). -->
<!-- ```{bash, comment='', echo=3, eval=Sys.which('bash') != '', message=FALSE} -->
<!-- cd ../..; -->
<!-- if [ ! -f 'theme.toml' ]; then exit 0; fi  # only run find below within the theme example site -->
<!-- find . -not -path '*/exampleSite/*' \( -name '*.html' -o -name '*.css' \) | xargs wc -l -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- I can certainly further reduce the code, for example, by eliminating the CSS, but I believe a tiny bit of CSS can greatly improve readability. You cannot really find many CSS frameworks that only contain 50 lines of code. -->
<!-- Although it is a minimal theme, it is actually fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS. With [a little bit customization](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/foot_custom.html), it can easily support LaTeX math expressions, e.g., -->
<!-- `$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$` -->
<!-- All pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme. -->
